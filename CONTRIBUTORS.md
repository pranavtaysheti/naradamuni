# Naradamuni Development

## What this program is and is not

This program is just a library to make it really easy to build small scripts for reddit bots. Therefore, this program does not and will not contain any frontend, end users are supposed to import this library and write the script themselves.

Naradamuni also aims to cover as many use cases as possible, so any pull request to expand the functionality including that of adding compatiblity to other platforms will be accepted, but try to write code considering below guidelines.

## General coding guidelines

1. Keep the requirement for external library minimum.
2. Keep the code cross compatible do NOT add dependency on any OS specific library.
3. Do NOT hesitate to use cutting edge features introduced like type hinting, match case, etc.to keep the code tidy.
4. Code should be as documented as possible, self explainatory functions may be left out but generally try to document the code in reStructuredText format. Self-documenting code is highly encouraged.
4. English documentation is highly encouraged. 
4. Follow KISS "Keep It Simple Stupid" (from Arch Linux). Do not over engineer things, find the simplest practicle solution for the problem.
5. Be as "Pythonic" as possible.
6. Read the /docs
6. Using standards is encouraged but not compulsary. For example, if an hacky solution is easier/ faster or just "pragmatic" than standard solution, use it.
6. Other general common sense applies.
 
## General community guidelines

1. Be good and respectful towards others and other common sense applies.
